# Beorhtmund
The projects on my page are currently made with just HTML and CSS. As I learn more my page will get updated regularly.
https://beorhtmund.github.io

New projects made with Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React and Redux will be up in a few weeks.

## Tribute Page
This page is a tribute to Wernher Von Braun for his role in the advancement of space exploration.

FIX: I need to center the list element to the center of the page and then align the text to the left.

## Survey Page
I made this survey page about programming languages with a few question regarding them.

FIX: The radio and checkbox inputs should be centered within their parent element. Set a better background image.

## *Product Page
This page is about a motorcycle dealer and is not on my portfolio yet but can be found at https://beorhtmund.github.io/page/product.html
\
I can add a shopping basket for motorcycle parts and a login page in the future.

FIX: The spacing in the navbar is not even. Images need to be placed horizontally on bigger screens, I should use grid instead.

## Technical Documentation
For the documentation page I made it about HTML.

FIX: I couldn't figure out how to place HTML code inside the code elements, so I will need to use jQuery's .text() function. The content's left margin for mobile needs to be fixed.

## Random Quote Machine
Coming soon. This will be made using React, Bootstrap and Sass.
