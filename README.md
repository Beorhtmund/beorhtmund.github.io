The projects on my page are currently made with just HTML and CSS. As I learn more my page will get regularly updated.
I need to put each page into its own folder to make it look cleaner.

## Tribute Page
This page is a tribute to... for his role in the advancement of space exploration. (is it in or of space exploration)

## Survey Page
I made this survey page about programming languages but I need to make it responsive.

## Technical Documentation
For the documentation page I made it about HTML but I couldn't figure out how to place HTML code inside the code snippets, so I will need to work on that.
