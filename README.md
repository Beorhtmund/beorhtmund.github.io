The projects on my page are currently made with just HTML and CSS. As I learn more my page will get updated regularly.

## Tribute Page
This page is a tribute to Wernher Von Braun for his role in the advancement of space exploration.
I need to center the list element to the center of the page and then align the text to the left.

## Survey Page
I made this survey page about programming languages but I need to make it responsive.

## Technical Documentation
For the documentation page I made it about HTML but I couldn't figure out how to place HTML code inside the code snippets, so I will need to work on that.
