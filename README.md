As I learn more, my page will get updated regularly.

## *Tribute Page (HTML, CSS)
This page is a tribute to Wernher Von Braun for his role in the advancement of space exploration. It can be found at: https://beorhtmund.github.io/page/tribute.html

## *Survey Page (HTML, CSS)
I made this survey page about programming languages with a few question regarding them. This is no longer on my portfolio, but can still be seen at: https://beorhtmund.github.io/form/survey.html

## Motorcycle Dealer - Product Page (HTML, CSS)
This page is about a motorcycle dealer.
\
I can add a shopping basket for motorcycle parts and a login page in the future. This can be done using React.

## Technical Documentation (HTML, CSS)
For the documentation page I made it about HTML.

FIX: I couldn't figure out how to place HTML code inside the code elements, so I will need to use jQuery's .text() function. The content's left margin for mobile needs to be fixed. Each section needs more bottom margin.

## Random Quote Machine (React, MUI, Sass)
This page displays a random quote when the new quote button is clicked.

FIX: Add button shortcut, so on enter the new quote button is pressed. Make this responsive. Set a better url address. Fetch method needs to be redone.

## *Markdown Previewer
Coming soon.
