# Beorhtmund
As I learn more, my page will get updated regularly. I will start adding JavaScript to my projects.
https://beorhtmund.github.io

FIX: I need to change the navbar so it fades from dark to light.

## *Tribute Page (HTML, CSS)
This page is a tribute to Wernher Von Braun for his role in the advancement of space exploration. It can be found at: https://beorhtmund.github.io/page/tribute.html

FIX: I need to center the list element to the center of the page and then align the text to the left.

## Survey Page (HTML, CSS)
I made this survey page about programming languages with a few question regarding them.

FIX: The radio and checkbox inputs should be centered within their parent element. Set a better background image.

## *Product Page (HTML, CSS)
This page is about a motorcycle dealer and is not on my portfolio yet but can be found at: https://beorhtmund.github.io/page/product.html
\
I can add a shopping basket for motorcycle parts and a login page in the future. This can be done using React.

FIX: The spacing in the navbar is not even. Images need to be placed horizontally on bigger screens, I should use grid instead.

## Technical Documentation (HTML, CSS)
For the documentation page I made it about HTML.

FIX: I couldn't figure out how to place HTML code inside the code elements, so I will need to use jQuery's .text() function. The content's left margin for mobile needs to be fixed.

## Random Quote Machine (React, MUI, Sass)
This page displays a random quote when the new quote button is clicked.

FIX: Add button shortcut, so on enter the new quote button is pressed. Make this responsive. Set a better url address. Fetch method needs to be redone.

## *Markdown Previewer
Coming soon.
